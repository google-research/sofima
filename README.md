# SOFIMA

SOFIMA (Scalable Optical Flow-based Image Montaging and Alignment) is a tool
for stitching, aligning and warping large 2d, 3d and 4d microscopy datasets.

# Installation

SOFIMA is implemented purely in Python, and does not require a build step. To
install it directly from the repository, run:

```shell
  pip install git+https://github.com/google-research/sofima
```

# Overview

SOFIMA uses optical flow regularized with an elastic mesh to establish
maps between data in different coordinate systems. Both the [flow estimator](flow_field.py)
as well as the [mesh solver](mesh.py) are implemented in [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax)
and will automatically take advantage of GPU acceleration if the hardware if available.

A core data structure used throughout the project is a *coordinate map* stored
as a dense array of relative offsets (see the module docstring in [map_utils.py](map_utils.py)
for details). Among other uses, this is the representation of the estimated flow fields
and the mesh node positions.
